The house is tucked in a dense bit of woods rumored to hold the Bandit Jack’s lost treasure. You think you hear a boy’s laughter coming from the trees, but that’s impossible. The closest neighbor is five miles away and, from what you’ve been told, hard of hearing. The only one here is you. One corner of the old house has sunk, pulling the bricks apart in a way that reminds you of teeth. You have the distinct sensation of being watched, but all the windows are dark. \n\n The key is in your hand. \n Would you like to go inside?",

The view from here is beautiful—a grassy lawn, a winding dirt road that disappears into the forest—but when you turn back to the room, you see a splatter of blood on the opposite wall. The man who lived here before was an experimental physicist playing with pocket universes. You knew he’d gone missing—you’d agreed to search the house for clues of where he might have gone—but no one had said anything about murder. Would you like to keep exploring the house, or is it time to leave?",
